  <h2>Peacock</h2>
  <div class="bird-section">
    <div class="text">
      The peacock, a bird renowned for its dazzling beauty, is a symbol of grace and majesty.
      The male, known as a peacock, is famous for its elaborate and iridescent tail feathers, which it fans out in a spectacular display during courtship.
      These feathers, a kaleidoscope of blues, greens, and golds, feature striking "eyespot" patterns. The female, or peahen, is more modest in appearance, typically displaying a muted brown and green plumage.
      Found primarily in Asia and parts of Africa, peacocks are not only a visual delight but also hold cultural significance in various traditions, often symbolizing royalty, beauty, and immortality.

  <h2>Parrot</h2>
  <div class="bird-section">
    <div class="text">
      Parrots, belonging to the order Psittaciformes, are a diverse and fascinating group of birds found predominantly in tropical and subtropical regions around the world.
      Renowned for their vibrant plumage, which can range from single bright colors to intricate multi-colored patterns, they are instantly recognizable by their strong, curved beaks and unique zygodactyl feet
      (two toes pointing forward, two backward), which aid in climbing and manipulating objects.

  <h2>Humming bird</h2>
  <div class="bird-section">
    <div class="text">
      Hummingbirds are the world's smallest birds, famous for their incredible flying abilities and dazzling colors.
      They are the only birds that can hover in mid-air and fly backward, thanks to their unique wing movements.
      With a metabolism so high that their hearts can beat over 1,200 times per minute, they must constantly feed on flower nectar and tiny insects to maintain their energy.
      Their name comes from the distinct "humming" sound made by their rapidly beating wings, a sound that signals their presence as they zip through gardens and forests.
