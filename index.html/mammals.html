    <h1 class="heading">About Mammals</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Mammals are warm-blooded vertebrates that have hair or fur and produce milk to feed their young.</li>
      <li>They can regulate their body temperature, give birth to live young 
        (with some exceptions like monotremes), and possess mammary glands.</li>
      <li>
        Mammals are divided into three main groups:
        <ol>
          <li>Monotremes - egg-laying mammals</li>
          <li>Metatherians - marsupials that give birth to underdeveloped young, which continue to develop in a pouch</li>
          <li>Eutherians - placental mammals that give birth to fully developed young</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Monotremes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Monotremes are the only group of mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to living young.</li>
      <li>They have a leathery shell around their eggs,similar to reptiles.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="mammals-section">
      <div class="text">
        The echidna is a monotreme mammal, meaning it lays eggs instead of giving birth to live young. 
        After the leathery-shelled eggs hatch, the tiny young (called puggles) stay in the mother’s pouch for protection and feeding on milk.
        Echidnas have spines covering their back for defense, a long sticky tongue for catching ants and termites, and are found mainly in Australia and New Guinea.

    </div>
    
    <h2>Metatherians</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Metatherians,also known as marsupials,give birth to underdeveloped young that continue their development inside their mother's pouch.</li>
      <li>They have a short gestation period and the young are born in a very immature state.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="mammals-section">
      <div class="text">
        Kangaroos are metatherian mammals, meaning they give birth to underdeveloped young that continue their development inside the mother’s pouch.
        They have a short gestation period of about a month, after which the tiny joey crawls into the pouch and stays attached to a teat for several months.
        They are herbivorous animals, feeding mainly on grasses and leaves, and are well adapted for hopping locomotion using their strong hind legs and tail for balance.

    <h3>Eutherians</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Eutherian mammals have prolonged gestation periods, with the fetus developing inside the mother, nourished via a placenta for optimal growth.</li>
      <li>These mammals give birth to live young, fully developed after being nourished through the placenta, unlike egg-laying monotremes or pouch-raising marsupials.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="mammals-section">
      <div class="text">
        Whales, awe-inspiring eutherian mammals of the cetacean order, thrive in vast oceans, with the blue whale growing up to 100 feet long.
        Adapted for marine life, species like orcas and humpbacks use echolocation to navigate and hunt in deep waters. 
        They often live in tight-knit groups called pods, which are social units where whales cooperate, communicate through complex vocalizations, and support each other, showcasing their intricate social bonds.
